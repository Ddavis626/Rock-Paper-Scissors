# Rock-Paper-Scissors
This is a take of the classic game of chance

Player One will type in their input and Player two will type in theirs.
The text will appear as white so there is not cheating.
When you press the "lock in" button, the winner (or a tie) will appear in the space provided.

May the odds be ever in your favor
